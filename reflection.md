# Reflection on User Profile Management and Professional Status Upgrade Feature

# Purpose
The purpose of the user profile management and professional status upgrade feature is to allow users to update their profile information, like their name, bio, and location. Admins and managers also have the ability to upgrade a user’s status to "professional." This helps users keep their profiles up-to-date, and only admins or managers can grant professional status.

# Feature Implementation
For this project, I worked on the user profile management feature, which lets users update their profile details through an API. I started by creating an API endpoint to update basic information like the user's name, bio, and location. At first, I ran into a problem with invalid data being submitted, but I fixed it by adding input validation to ensure the data was correct.

After that, I worked on creating an API endpoint for admins and managers to upgrade users to professional status. To make sure only the right people could perform this action, I added role-based access control. The challenge I faced here was that non-admin users were initially able to perform the upgrade. I fixed this by adding a check to verify the user’s role before allowing the upgrade.

Next, I worked on updating the user profile page to show the professional status. At first, it wasn’t displaying correctly, but I fixed it by adjusting the front-end code. I also faced issues with updating the user profile in the database, as some updates weren’t being saved. I solved this by reviewing the database schema and making sure the fields were correctly mapped.

Finally, the front-end had some issues displaying the updated profile information, but I fixed it by modifying the code to bind and display the updated data properly. Even though I spent a lot of time working on this feature, I wasn’t able to complete some optional enhancements, like allowing users to add dynamic profile fields and creating a manager search interface. The core functionality is working, but these additional features were not completed due to errors and challenges I faced while debugging.

# Configuration
To implement this feature, I made some changes to the system configuration. I added role-based access control, which ensures that only admins and managers can upgrade users to professional status. This was done by adding a role check before the upgrade action is allowed.

I also updated the database schema to include a new field, is_professional, to track whether a user has been upgraded to professional status. This required updating the user model and applying a migration to the database to include this new field.

# Database Migration
The database migration updated the user table to include the new is_professional field. However, some of the tests for this migration weren’t fully completed due to errors and bugs found. 

# Conclusion
In summary, this feature was an important part of the project, allowing users to update their profiles and enabling admins and managers to upgrade users to professional status. While the core functionality works, some optional improvements were left unfinished because of errors encountered during development. This project helped me improve my problem-solving and debugging skills and gave me valuable experience in handling web application development challenges.
